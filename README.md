# 3DProcessing
This program demonstrates spectral mesh processing and allows for reconstruction of a 3D mesh using a selected number of eigenvectors and modification of their spectral coefficients for controlled mesh deformation.

There is now a funcitoning UI allowing control over the eigen decomposition and reconstruction.

The code requires OpenGL, GLFW, ANN, and Eigen to function.

Mesh can be rotated using the mouse or arrow keys.

Written using Visual Studio 2015, windows 10.
