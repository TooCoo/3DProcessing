A Description


Press 'H' when the window appears for a list of commands.

Press 'K' to find some eigen vectors and reconstruct shape from the largest eigen vectors. Starts at one vector used and goes up by one after each 'K' press.

The code requires OpenGL, GLFW, ANN, and Eigen to function.

Key G adds noise to mesh, I does 10 iterations of exmplicit smoothing, L does 1 iteration of implicit smoothing.

Mesh can be rotated using the mouse or arrow keys.

Written using Visual Studio 2015, windows 10.
